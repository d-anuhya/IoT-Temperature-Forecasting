# IoT-Temperature-Forecasting
In this Dataset, we have the temperature readings from IoT devices installed outside and inside of an anonymous room. Because the device was in the testing phase, it was uninstalled or shut off several times during the entire reading period, which caused some outliers and missing values.
<br>
**Dataset details:**
- id : unique IDs for each reading
- room_id/id : room id in which device was installed(currently 'admin room' only for example purpose).
- noted_date : date and time of reading
- temp : temperature readings
- out/in : whether the reading was taken from a device installed inside or outside of the room
<br>
**We can enjoy finding out the following:**

* The relationship between inside and outside temperature 

* Trend or seasonality in the data 

* Forecasting future temperature by using time-series modelling 

* Characteristic tendency through year, month, week or day/night and so on...
<br>
**Goal of this notebook:**

+ Practice data cleansing technique

+ Practice EDA technique to deal with time-series data

+ Series Decomposition into trend/seasonality

+ Practice visualising technique

+ Practice time-series modeling technique

+ Prophet library use
